it O

the O

eliminate O

 O
However O

caught O

Even O
a O

that O
is O
the O
gamble O

when O

 O
Virtus.pro B-ORG

a O

 O
This O

it O
is O
unlikely O
any O
major O

take O
place O
. O
This O

took O
place O
two O
days O
after O
the O

of O
one O
of O
the O

this O

 O
This O

on O

24 O
, O
more O
than O
24 O
hours O
before O
they O
revealed O
the O
team O

 O
No O
changes O
were O
made O
to O
the O
TI9 B-TOURN
roster O
that O
challenged O
OG B-ORG
in O
the O
grand O

, O
which O
means O
Nigma B-ORG

likely O
be O
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
teams O
at O
the O
DreamLeague B-TOURN
Season I-TOURN

qualifiers O
. O

 O
We O
knew O
based O
on O
Kuro B-PLAYER

comments O
following O
the O
split O
from O

that O
he O
and O
team O
manager O
Mohamed O
" O

wanted O
to O
strike O
out O
on O
their O

is O
the O
first O

) O
to O
control O
every O
aspect O
of O
their O

destiny O
. O

 O
We O
can O
only O
assume O
that O
the O
team O
will O
continue O
competing O
in O
the O
European O
region O
after O
seeing O
so O
much O
success O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
confirmation O
of O
that O
choice O
shown O
in O

all O
we O

 O
More O

for O
now O
, O
expect O

was O
the O
more O
convincing O
and O
consistent O
team O
throughout O

 O
The O

The O
two O
Filipino O

put O
their O
skill O

The O
first O
game O
was O
the O
Armel B-PLAYER

while O
Gabbi B-PLAYER
created O

 O
The O

performance O
by O

, O
along O
with O
his O
trusty O
partner O
Earthshaker B-AVATAR

and O
an O
atypical O
Armel B-PLAYER

served O
mostly O
as O
a O

to O
VG B-ORG

In O
both O

the O

 O
In O
the O
third O
game O

their O
faith O
in O

another O
cheesy O
combo O
, O
Chen B-AVATAR

 O

up O

a O

with O

away O

it O

 O

The O
only O
position O
that O

. O

 O
With O
three O
former O
C9 B-ORG

joining O
the O

EG B-ORG
will O
have O
plenty O
of O
synergy O
to O
work O
off O

Svenskeren B-PLAYER

Zeyzal B-PLAYER
were O
essential O
parts O
of O
their O
team O

success O
this O
past O

should O
help O
this O
new O
roster O
find O
success O
right O
off O

Kumo B-PLAYER
also O
has O
some O
experience O

the O
two O
former O

which O
could O
make O
his O
transition O
into O
the O

a O
bit O
easier O
. O

 O
As O
for O
mid O
laners O
, O
EG B-ORG
will O
need O
to O
reach O
into O
the O
North O

taking O
up O
both O

One O
name O
that O
comes O
to O

is O
former O

Eugene B-PLAYER

that O

wo O

Another O
possibility O
is O
Tanner B-PLAYER

, O
who O
’s O
showed O
plenty O
of O
promise O
and O
growth O
this O
year O
with O

 O
EG B-ORG
’s O
current O
lineup O
looks O
decent O
, O
but O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
question O
marks O
that O
surround O
this O
roster O
— O
from O
Kumo B-PLAYER

rookie O
season O
in O

Until O

announces O
its O
mid O

, O
however O
, O
it O
’ll O
be O
hard O
to O
judge O
this O
team O

true O
potential O
in O
the O
organization O
’s O
return O
to O
competitive O

. O
DAMWON B-ORG

reportedly O
headed O
into O
2020 O
with O
the O

 O
This O
young O
fiery O

ready O
to O
run O

 O

a O
relatively O
successful O
inaugural O

, O
DAMWON B-ORG

has O
reportedly O
decided O
to O
build O
on O
the O
success O
of O

and O
stick O
with O
the O
same O
League B-GAME
of I-GAME

roster O
for O
next O
year O
. O

 O
DAMWON B-ORG
has O
its O
entire O
starting O
roster O
under O
contract O
until O
November O
2020 O
, O
according O
to O
FOMOS O
reporter O
Kenzi O
. O
And O
since O
they O
gained O
plenty O
of O
experience O
both O
domestically O
and O
internationally O
in O
2019 O
, O
they O
should O
be O
able O
to O
improve O
their O
strategies O
and O
playstyle O
for O
next O
year O
’s O
Spring O
Split O
. O

 O
DAMWON B-ORG
recently O
parted O
ways O
with O
several O
of O

 O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
LCK B-ORG
teams O
that O
will O
be O
staying O
with O
its O
roster O
through O
the O
2019 O
offseason O
. O
Multiple O
players O
have O
switched O
teams O
over O
the O
past O

many O

 O
It O

will O
help O
or O
hinder O
the O

efforts O
next O

Some O
people O

an O

 O
Earlier O
this O
year O
, O
the O
two O
teams O
faced O
off O
in O
the O
MSI B-TOURN
semifinals O
. O
The O
two O
teams O
were O
evenly O
matched O
until O
G2 B-ORG
pulled O
ahead O
in O
the O
fifth O
game O
. O
G2 B-ORG
went O
on O
to O
win O
the O
tournament O
and O
swept O
through O
the O
LEC B-TOURN
Summer I-TOURN
Split I-TOURN
before O
Worlds B-TOURN
. O

 O
SKT B-ORG
, O
however O
, O
dropped O
to O
ninth O
place O
during O
the O
LCK B-TOURN
Summer I-TOURN
Split I-TOURN
. O
They O
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
a O
slump O
. O
But O
beginning O
in O
week O
four O
, O
the O
team O
went O
on O
a O
nine O
- O
match O
win O
streak O
to O
secure O
a O
spot O
in O
the O
playoffs O
. O
SKT B-ORG
’s O
rise O
did O
n’t O
stop O
there O
. O
They O
tore O
through O
the O
playoffs O
to O
claim O
first O
in O
the O
region O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
the O
last O
remaining O
LCK B-TOURN
team O
, O
SKT B-ORG
are O
primed O
for O
a O
total O
takeover O
. O

 O
Going O
into O
Worlds B-TOURN
, O
SKT B-ORG
were O
placed O
into O
an O
unexpectedly O
tough O
group O
with O
Fnatic B-ORG
and O
Royal B-ORG
Never I-ORG
Give I-ORG
Up I-ORG
. O
But O
they O
still O
came O
out O
with O
a O
5 O
- O
1 O
record O
. O
The O
wins O
were O
n’t O
always O
one O
- O
sided O
, O
however O
. O
The O
games O
were O
often O
a O
contest O
of O
which O
team O
could O
gain O
an O
edge O
, O
especially O
against O
RNG B-ORG
. O
SKT B-ORG
, O
however O
, O
proved O
time O
and O
time O
again O
they O
have O
the O
superior O
teamfight O
. O
Even O
if O
SKT B-ORG
fell O
behind O
early O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
always O
whittle O
their O
way O
back O
into O
a O
game O
by O
outmaneuvering O
their O
opponents O
. O

success O
this O
Worlds B-TOURN

He O
’s O
the O
one O
who O
aptly O
enables O

to O
move O
across O

and O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O

seong I-PLAYER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
has O
essentially O
been O
the O
ideal O
ADC O
. O
His O
positioning O
has O
been O
immaculate O
, O
oftentimes O
skirting O
between O
life O
and O
death O
as O
he O
navigates O
through O
fights O
. O
He O
’s O
a O
consistent O
source O
of O
damage O
that O
SKT B-ORG
can O
depend O
on O
. O

 O
Although O
SKT B-ORG
have O
had O
a O
commanding O
showing O
thus O
far O
, O
the O
team O
faltered O
during O
their O
quarterfinal O
series O
against O
Splyce B-ORG
, O
where O
SKT B-ORG
were O
expected O
to O
shine O
. O
By O
game O
three O
, O
it O
seemed O
like O
SKT B-ORG
took O
a O
step O
back O
and O
lost O
their O
proactivity O
. O
Splyce B-ORG
were O
able O
to O
exert O
so O
much O
pressure O
in O
the O
early O
game O
that O
SKT B-ORG
could O
n’t O
come O
back O
. O
Even O
in O
game O
four O
, O
SKT B-ORG
looked O
out O
of O
sorts O
and O
uncoordinated O
. O
Ideally O
, O
SKT B-ORG
’s O
series O
with O
Splyce B-ORG
should O
reinvigorate O
them O
to O
perform O
by O
the O
time O
they O
face O
G2 B-ORG
. O

 O
The O
pride O
of O
EU O

 O
G2 B-ORG
already O
topped O
the O
LEC B-TOURN
standings O
when O
they O
joined O
the O
region O
in O
2016 O
. O
But O
this O
year O
, O
they O
’ve O
doubled O
down O
on O
their O
position O
as O
best O
in O
the O
West O
. O
Two O
LEC B-TOURN
titles O
, O
along O
with O
an O
MSI B-TOURN
championship O
, O
and O
now O
G2 B-ORG
are O
on O
their O
way O
to O
claiming O
a O
Worlds O
title O
. O

 O
They O
showed O
a O
moment O
of O
weakness O
against O
Griffin B-ORG
, O
which O
cost O
them O
the O
first O
seed O
in O
their O
group O
. O
But O
they O
’ve O
otherwise O
demonstrated O
their O
superior O
map O
control O
and O
glided O
through O
just O
about O
every O
other O
match O
so O
far O
. O
Even O
during O
their O
difficult O
series O
against O
DAMWON B-ORG
Gaming I-ORG
, O
G2 B-ORG
seemed O
to O
always O
have O
a O
plan O
of O
attack O
. O
If O
their O
opponent O
claims O
a O
turret O
, O
G2 B-ORG
will O
likely O
be O
taking O
an O
objective O
of O
their O
own O
in O
response O
. O

 O
Luka B-PLAYER
“ I-PLAYER

Perković I-PLAYER
has O
been O
the O
star O
for O
G2 B-ORG
, O
enabling O
them O
to O
play O
just O
about O
any O
style O
due O
to O
his O
diverse O
champion O
pool O
with O
options O
like O
Yasuo B-AVATAR
and O
Zoe B-AVATAR
. O
Unfortunately O
for O
G2 B-ORG
, O
non O
- O
traditional O
bot O
lanes O
have O
proven O
to O
be O
inferior O
to O
traditional O
lanes O
. O
But O
there O
’s O
the O
opportunity O
to O
surprise O
SKT B-ORG
with O
a O
sneaky O
pick O
from O
Perkz B-PLAYER
. O
Marcin B-PLAYER
“ I-PLAYER
Jankos I-PLAYER
” I-PLAYER
Jankowski I-PLAYER

often O
the O
one O

who O

This O
allows O
the O

to O
stay O
ahead O
even O
when O

take O
a O
good O
trade O

 O
Where O

struggle O

, O
is O
in O
the O
early O
game O

Their O
two O

both O
lost O
early O
on O

Considering O
SKT B-ORG
have O
significantly O
amped O
up O
their O
early O
game O
, O
this O
will O
likely O
be O
a O
point O
of O

throughout O

Still O
, O
G2 B-ORG

already O
beaten O

CoreJJ B-PLAYER

is O
to O
stop O

considered O
one O
of O
the O
worst O

It O

taken O
seriously O
by O
very O
few O

with O
the O

avoiding O
it O
altogether O

Rather O
than O
grinding O

honing O
their O

against O
a O
range O
of O
players O
, O
pros O
often O
choose O
to O
play O
in O

house O

instead O
. O

 O
One O
of O
the O
biggest O
reasons O
for O
this O

, O
it O

plenty O

if O
some O

a O

, O
they O
could O
be O

by O
the O

 O

Their O

Attitude I-ORG
looked O
all O

It O

clear O
G2 B-ORG
were O
leagues O
ahead O

But O
against O
Griffin B-ORG
, O
G2 B-ORG
appeared O
to O
be O
caught O
off O

. O
Griffin B-ORG
relentlessly O
took O
over O
the O
early O
game O
in O
their O

and O
tiebreaker O
. O

 O
While O
G2 B-ORG
were O
breezing O

were O
ramping O
up O

And O
much O
like O
Griffin B-ORG

DAMWON B-ORG
Gaming I-ORG
slowly O
rose O
to O
the O

DAMWON B-ORG

significant O
holes O
in O
their O
early O
game O
throughout O
the O
play O

in O
stage O
, O
but O
they O
sorted O
out O
this O
weakness O
as O
they O
progressed O
through O
groups O
to O
secure O
the O
first O
seed O
at O
5 O

G2 B-ORG
should O
know O
that O

anymore O
, O
but O
will O
they O
learn O
this O
in O
time O
for O

against O
DAMWON B-ORG

 O
Time O
to O
refocus O

 O
G2 B-ORG
may O
have O
faltered O
near O
the O
end O
of O
the O
group O
stage O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n’t O
take O
away O
from O
the O
dominance O
they O
’ve O
shown O
throughout O
the O
year O
. O
The O
reigning O
MSI B-TOURN
champions O
strolled O
through O
the B-TOURN
Worlds I-TOURN
group O
stage O
for O
a O
reason O
. O

 O
They O
have O
five O
of O
the O
best O
individual O
players O
in O
the O
LEC B-TOURN
. O
They O
’ve O
shown O
incredible O
versatility O
largely O
thanks O
to O
their O
bot O
laner O
Luka B-PLAYER
“ I-PLAYER
Perkz I-PLAYER
” I-PLAYER
Perković I-PLAYER
and O
his O
champion O
pool O
. O
Since O
he O
started O
off O
as O
G2 B-ORG
’s O
mid O
laner O
, O
Perkz B-PLAYER
has O
become O
versed O
in O
playing O
mages O
and O
other O
mid O
champions O
like O
Yasuo O
. O
This O
has O
allowed O
G2 B-ORG
to O
experiment O
and O
succeed O
with O
unique O
bot O
lanes O
like O
Zoe B-AVATAR
plus O
Rakan B-AVATAR
or O
Pyke B-AVATAR
and O
Yuumi B-AVATAR
. O

 O
Throughout O
the O
year O
, O
Perkz B-PLAYER
has O
learned O
how O
to O
play O
traditional O
ADCs O
as O
well O
, O
so O
G2 B-ORG
does O
n’t O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
interesting O
picks O
to O
win O
. O
With O
Perkz B-PLAYER
on O
a O
typical O
marksman O
, O
G2 B-ORG
can O
play O
a O
standard O
back O
- O
to O
- O
front O
game O
and O
win O
. O
We O
’ve O
already O
seen O
this O
at O
Worlds B-TOURN
in O
their O
first O
match O
against O
Griffin B-ORG
and O
Cloud9 B-ORG
. O

 O
Unfortunately O
for O
G2 B-ORG
, O
Perkz B-PLAYER
’s I-PLAYER
ability O
to O
play O
anything O
likely O
wo O
n’t O
be O
a O
determining O
factor O
in O
their O
series O
against O
DAMWON B-ORG
. O
Non O
- O
traditional O
bot O
lanes O
— O
mage O
lanes O
in O
particular O
— O
have O
had O
a O
poor O
win O
rate O
with O
a O
1 O

13 O
record O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
group O
stage O
. O
And O
traditional O
ADCs O
like O
Xayah B-AVATAR
and O
Kai’Sa B-AVATAR
are O
still O
preferred O
due O
to O
their O
consistent O
damage O
and O
siege O
capability O
. O

 O
Additionally O
, O
the B-TOURN
Worlds I-TOURN
meta O
has O
revolved O
around O

rather O
than O

. O
While O
Perkz B-PLAYER
is O
more O
than O
capable O
of O
performing O

the O
onus O
will O
be O
on O

The O

also O
their O
first O

in O
the O
LCK B-TOURN

 O
DAMWON B-ORG
rose O
through O
the O
Korean B-TOURN
challenger I-TOURN

and O
beat O
out O
long O

standing O
teams O
like O
KT B-ORG

to O
earn O
the O

at O

DAMWON B-ORG

 O
They O
’ve O
become O
absolute O
lane O
bullies O
in O
the O
LCK B-TOURN
. O
Nuguri B-PLAYER
is O
n’t O
afraid O
of O
taking O
aggressive O
builds O
, O
like O
Kleptomancy O
Vladimir O
with O
Cull O
as O
his O
starting O
item O
, O
even O
in O
unfavorable O
matchups O
. O
And O
ShowMaker O
has O
shown O
up O
time O
and O
time O
again O
to O
clean O
up O
after O
DAMWON B-ORG

. O
He O
’s O
been O
a O
reliable O
source O
of O
damage O
and O
carry O
threat O
throughout O
Worlds B-TOURN
thus O
far O
. O

 O
Although O
DAMWON B-ORG
are O
new O
to O
Worlds B-TOURN
, O
they O
still O
have O
an O
impeccable O
record O
. O
They O
went O
undefeated O
in O
the O
play O
- O
in O
group O
stage O
and O
finished O
with O
a O
5 O

1 O
record O
coming O
out O
of O
groups O
. O
Their O
record O
, O
however O
, O
should O
be O
taken O
with O
a O
grain O
of O
salt O
. O
During O
the O
play O
- O
in O
stage O
, O
they O
lost O
nearly O
every O
early O
game O
. O
They O
lacked O
proactivity O
, O
which O
left O
them O
struggling O
against O
teams O
like O
Lowkey B-ORG
Esports I-ORG
. O
Moving O
into O
the O
main O
stage O
, O
DAMWON B-ORG
still O
struggled O
early O
. O
But O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
improved O
on O
this O
weakness O
throughout O
the O
tournament O
. O
In O
their O
rematch O
against O
Invictus B-ORG
Gaming I-ORG
, O
DAMWON B-ORG
were O
playing O
around O
their O
vision O
to O
respond O

 O
DAMWON B-ORG

rise O
to O
the O
quarterfinals O
was O
n’t O
as O
painless O
as O
G2 B-ORG

, O
but O
they O
’ve O
clearly O
shown O
improvements O
throughout O

The O

, O
we O

after O
listening O

we O

What O

that O

talk O
about O
those O
last O
two O

In O
2017 O
, O

by O
a O

a O

in O
the O
quarterfinals O
by O
pushing O
them O
to O
five O
maps O
, O
but O
ultimately O
lost O

In O
2018 O
, O
beating O

was O
the O
implicit O
goal O
, O
but O
they O
never O
got O
that O
far O
, O
dumped O
again O
in O
the O
quarterfinals O
by O
the O
United O

( O
Notably O
, O

also O
lost O

very O
first O

2016 O
, O
again O
to O
South O

) O

 O
This O
year O
, O
2019 O
, O
would O
be O
different O

 O
“ O
Last O

we O
just O
thought O
as O

, O
as O
everybody O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
only O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
Korea O
, O
so O
we O
only O
reviewed O
for O
Korea O
, O
” O
Sinatraa B-PLAYER
said O
. O
“ O
But O
this O
year O
we O
reviewed O
literally O
every O
possible O

that O
we O
could O
play O

every O

everything O
about O

of O

up O

as O

summarily O
dispatched O

Indy B-PLAYER

onstage O
that O
the O

victory O
was O
entirely O
expected O
, O
he O
was O
n’t O
being O
flippant O

but O
rather O
affirming O
the O
sheer O
amount O
of O
work O
that O
went O
into O
this O
year O

tournament O
. O
If O
every O

possibility O
was O
truly O
accounted O
for O
, O
then O
why O
should O
there O
be O
any O
surprises O

 O
In O
order O
to O
break O
out O
of O

, O
though O

first O
the O

to O
practice O
selective O

 O
“ O

really O

” O

 O
Those O
last O
two O
years O
of O
disappointment O

It O
’s O
like O
they O
never O
happened O
. O
If O
that O
sounds O
like O
an O
impossible O
task O
, O
consider O
that O
half O
of O
Team O
USA O

starting O
lineup O
was O
plucked O
from O
the O
San B-ORG

Yes O
, O
the O
same O
one O
that O
lost O
their O
opening O
match O
of O
the O
2019 O
playoffs O
, O
then O
did O
n’t O
drop O
another O

for O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
march O
to O
the B-TOURN
Overwatch I-TOURN

Even O
when O
they O
felt O
in O
their O
bones O
that O
they O
were O
destined O
for O
a O
championship O
, O
they O
chose O
the O
mindset O
of O

on O

It O

 O

there O

we O
also O
saw O

The O

 O
Denmark O

never O

it O

once O

forced O
two O

debuted O
a O
mostly O
new O

that O
was O
largely O
untested O

 O
It O
was O

it O
seemed O

would O
take O
on O

most O
distinctive O
in O

all O

we O
invested O
in O
Team B-ORG

over O
the O
last O
three O
years O
with O

? O

 O
Let O
me O
make O
it O
clear O
— O
we’re O
really O
excited O
about O
esports O
. O
We O
started O
in O
traditional O
radio O
, O
and O
we O
’re O
in O
the O
business O

We O
’re O
transforming O
our O

and O
this O
is O
another O
path O
for O
us O
to O
do O
that O
and O
reach O
the O
next O
generation O
. O
As O
for O
my O
experience O
with O

, O
I O
find O
it O
very O
enlightening O
and O
encouraging O
and O
it O
gets O
me O
excited O
about O
the O
opportunities O
ahead O
. O

 O

There O
’s O
a O
lot O
of O
similarities O
between O
esports O
and O
radio O
and O
what O
we O
’ve O
done O
in O

last O
58 O

the O

of O
a O

 O
As O
we O
dive O
headfirst O
into O
the O
offseason O
, O
who O
are O
the O
most O
intriguing O
players O
that O
are O
potentially O
on O
the O
market O
? O
Now O
that O
Player O
Impact O
Ratings O
for O
the O
2019 O

are O
set O
in O
stone O
, O
I O
have O
the O
perfect O
tool O
to O
help O
me O
answer O
this O
question O
. O

 O
Let O
’s O
start O
out O
by O
setting O
some O
limits O
on O
this O
list O
of O
impactful O
players O
. O
First O
, O
I O
’ll O
be O
pulling O
from O
both O
the O
pool O
of O
free O
agents O
as O
well O
as O
players O
under O
team O
options O
, O
as O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
teams O
will O
exercise O
those O
. O
Second O
, O
players O
will O
be O
subject O
to O
a O
maps O
- O
played O
limit O
, O
which O
is O
already O
required O
to O
be O
ranked O
in O
PIR O
. O
Third O
, O
since O
it O
’s O
free O
agency O
we O
’re O
talking O
about O
here O
, O
I O
’ve O
taken O
some O
steps O
to O
identify O
players O
who O
would O
usually O
be O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
their O
teams O
’ O
overall O
performance O
by O
introducing O
two O
new O
PIR O
- O
based O
stats O
: O
RPIR O
and O
TAPIR O
. O

 O
PIR O
, O
as O
a O
quick O
refresher O
, O
is O
a O
player O
rating O
based O
on O
a O
league O
- O
wide O
average O
of O
100 O
that O
is O
balanced O
within O
each O
patch O
as O
the O
season O
progresses O
. O
PIR O
is O
great O
for O
ranking O
players O
in O
a O
large O
aggregate O
, O
but O
team O
performance O
is O
still O
a O
factor O
in O
a O
players O
’ O
individual O
rating O
, O
as O
it O
ignores O
that O
factor O
entirely O
. O
Now O
, O
though O
, O
I O
’m O
proposing O
a O
new O
statistic O
that O
attempts O
to O
quantify O
a O
player O
’s O
individual O
influence O
on O
their O
team O
’s O
rating O
: O
Relative O
PIR O
( O
RPIR O
) O
. O
RPIR O
is O
a O
measure O
of O
a O
player O
’s O
PIR O
as O
a O
percentage O
relative O
to O
their O
team O
’s O
average O
PIR O
in O
a O
season O
— O
a O
handy O
way O
of O
seeing O
which O
players O
on O
a O
given O
team O
outperformed O
their O
team O
’s O
average O
performance O
and O
thus O
identifying O
diamonds O
in O
the O
rough O
. O

 O
However O
, O
RPIR O
in O
practice O
seems O
to O
only O
produce O
a O
list O
of O
players O
from O
bad O
teams O
. O
For O
a O
more O
holistic O
rating O
— O
one O
that O
also O
rewards O
players O
who O
excel O
on O
top O
teams O
— O
I’m O
also O
proposing O
Team O
- O
Adjusted O
PIR O
( O
TAPIR O
) O
. O
TAPIR O
is O
simply O
the O
product O
of O
RPIR O
and O
PIR O
, O
and O
provides O
several O
paths O
to O
good O
rankings O
. O

% O
( O
implying O
that O

out O
- O
performed O

) O
, O
producing O
a O
TAPIR O
value O
of O
116.51 O
, O
which O
was O
the O
ninth O
- O
highest O
in O

 O
We O

being O
about O
“ O
the O
best O
of O
us”—the O
players O
who O
have O
fought O
all O
year O
to O
prove O
who O
among O
them O
are O
worthy O
to O
hoist O
the O
trophy O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
. O
On O
Sunday O
, O
the O
“ O
best O
of O

” O
included O
not O
only O
the O
fans O
who O
sold O
out O
the O
Wells O

, O
but O
the O
ones O
at O
home O
, O
too O
, O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
packed O

parties O
, O
the O
ones O
that O
spammed O

, O
the O

that O
talked O

 O
You O
all O
are O
truly O
the O
best O
of O
us O
. O
At O
this O
point O
, O
it O
seems O
impossible O
that O
anyone O
would O
be O
unaware O
of O
the O
Vancouver B-ORG
Titans I-ORG
' O
tumultuous O
journey O
to O
the O
Overwatch B-TOURN
League I-TOURN
. O
Once O
belonging O
to O
an O
amateur O
Korean O
team O
named O
RunAway O
, O
the O
roster O
infamously O
suffered O
three O
heartbreaking O
Grand O
Finals O
losses O
before O
finally O
winning O
a O
championship O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
August O
2018 O
and O
joining O
the O
Titans B-ORG
organization O
shortly O
after O
. O

 O
As O
the O
Overwatch B-TOURN
League I-TOURN
Grand O
Finals O
drew O
nearer O
, O
the O
question O
on O
everybody O
's O
mind O
was O
: O
would O
we O
see O
the O
Titans B-TOURN
claim O
the O
most O
important O
championship O
of O
all O
, O
or O
would O
they O
collect O
yet O
another O
second O
- O
place O
finish O
? O

 O
It O
was O
a O
question O
that O
was O
answered O
swiftly O
as O
the O
match O
began O
. O
Right O
from O
the O
outset O
, O
when O
the O
San B-ORG
Francisco I-ORG
Shock I-ORG
shut O
out O
the O
Vancouver B-ORG
Titans I-ORG
on O
Lijiang O
Tower O
— O
a O
map O
that O
the O
Titans B-ORG
had O
been O
undefeated O
on O
in O
the O
postseason O
— O
the O
outcome O
began O
to O
feel O
like O
a O
foregone O
conclusion O
. O
All O
day O
, O
the O
Shock B-ORG
played O
at O
a O
blistering O
pace O
, O
making O
strategic O
roster O
changes O
on O
every O
map O
and O
pressing O
every O
single O
advantage O
they O
could O
find O
. O
The O
Titans B-ORG
looked O
uncharacteristically O
shaken O
and O
unprepared O
, O
barely O
even O
having O
a O
moment O
to O
breathe O
between O
teamfights O
, O
and O
very O
quickly O
found O
themselves O
staring O
down O
the O
barrel O
of O
a O
sweep O
. O

 O
As O
the O
final O
seconds O
of O
overtime O
on O
the O
final O
map O
dwindled O
away O
, O
the O
players O
of O
the O
San B-ORG
Francisco I-ORG
Shock I-ORG
leapt O
to O
their O
feet O
, O
throwing O
themselves O
at O
each O
other O
and O
shouting O
with O
joy O
as O
the O
Wells O
Fargo O
Center O
lit O
up O
in O
orange O
and O
gold O
. O
The O
giant O
LED O
screen O
above O
their O
heads O
declared O
, O
in O
bright O
, O
bold O
lettering O
: O

Kim I-PLAYER
took O
his O
hands O
off O
his O
keyboard O
and O
remained O
seated O
, O
staring O
wordlessly O
at O
the O
defeat O
screen O
, O
surrounded O
by O
orange O
confetti O
. O
His O
teammates O
mirrored O
him O
, O
sitting O
motionless O
in O
their O
chairs O
and O
reckoning O
with O
the O
loss O
that O
had O
just O
been O
handed O
to O
them O
. O

 O
It O
was O
n't O
the O
loss O
itself O
that O
had O
sent O
the O
Titans B-ORG
reeling O
; O
for O
Haksal B-PLAYER
, O
this O
was O
his O
sixth O
final O
and O
his O
fourth O
second O
- O
place O
finish O
. O
It O
was O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
loss O
that O
had O
taken O
everyone O
, O
from O
the O
players O
to O
the O
fans O
, O
by O
surprise O
. O
There O
had O
been O
high O
hopes O
surrounding O
the O
match O
, O
with O
many O
expecting O
a O
close O
series O
that O
would O
get O
taken O
to O
seven O
( O
or O
even O
eight O
) O
maps O
. O
Instead O
, O
the O
Shock B-ORG
ruthlessly O
dictated O
the O
pace O
of O
the O
match O
, O
while O
the O
Titans B-ORG
struggled O
to O
keep O
up O
. O
The O
match O
ended O
after O
just O
two O
hours O
, O
with O
the O
Shock B-ORG
standing O
victorious O
over O
their O
biggest O
rivals O
. O

 O

later O
said O
of O
the O
scoreline O
. O
“ O
We O
lost O
too O
easily O
. O
” O

 O
As O
the O
Titans B-ORG
filed O
in O
for O
their O
post O
- O
match O
press O
conference O
, O
the O
players O
looked O
far O
more O
subdued O
and O
serious O
than O
usual O
, O
a O
rarity O
for O
a O
team O
usually O
so O
boisterous O
and O
carefree O
, O
even O
in O
the O
face O
of O
defeat O
. O
Some O
were O
downcast O
, O
but O
after O
having O
experienced O
so O
many O
losses O
in O
finals O
— O
including O
one O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
again O
to O
the O
Shock B-ORG
in O
Stage O
2—it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
mental O
fortitude O
they O
'd O
built O
up O
after O
all O
this O
time O
was O
helping O
keep O
their O
emotions O
in O
check O
. O

 O
The O
players O
and O
staff O
were O
careful O
never O
to O
place O
the O
blame O
on O
anything O
but O
their O
own O
mistakes O
, O
giving O
short O
and O
pointed O
answers O
to O
questions O
about O
the O
heavy O
loss O
. O
As O
head O
coach O

Sub I-PLAYER
“ I-PLAYER
Pajion I-PLAYER
” I-PLAYER
Hwang I-PLAYER
put O
it O
, O
“ O
From O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
team O
that O
lost O
, O
anything O
we O
said O
would O
sound O
like O
an O
excuse O
. O
” O

 O
Often O
we O
want O
our O
losers O
to O
cry O
or O
at O
least O
be O
visibly O
heartbroken O
, O
to O
act O
as O
an O
emotional O
foil O
that O
shows O
us O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
winner O
's O
jubilation O
. O
But O
in O
this O
case O
— O
perhaps O
also O
because O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
defeat O
had O
left O
the O
Titans B-ORG
sufficiently O
stunned O
— O
all O
we O
got O
was O
quiet O
acceptance O
that O
the O
Shock B-ORG
had O
simply O
been O
the O
better O
team O
. O

 O
Of O
course O
the O
loss O
had O
affected O
the O
Titans B-ORG
, O
as O
any O
loss O
on O
that O
big O
a O
stage O

 O
I O

both O

are O
very O
even O
in O
this O
meta O

I O
think O
the O

so O
it O

hard O
to O
be O
certain O
who O

going O

win O

My O
choice O
is O
the O

because O

their O
hot O
streak O
and O
how O
fast O
they O
adapt O
to O
any O

thrown O
at O

they O

They O
're O
all O

Both O

are O
great O

but O
I O
think O
the O
Shock B-ORG
have O
been O
on O
another O
level O
recently O
. O
Being O
knocked O
into O
the O

made O
them O
angry O

brought O
something O
extra O
out O

that O
