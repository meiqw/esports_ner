one O
of O
the O
bigger O
names O
left O
on O
the O
market O
following O
the O
first O

. O
It O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
for O

to O
pick O
him O
up O
and O
pair O
him O
with O

 O
That O
core O
is O
made O
up O
of O
three O
veterans O
who O
have O
all O
spent O
time O
on O
winning O
rosters O
that O
competed O
at O
multiple O
Internationals O
, O
which O
is O
something O
that O
’s O
proven O
to O
be O
a O
solid O
building O
block O
for O
any O
team O
. O
All O
three O
players O
have O
defined O
roles O
that O
they O
excel O
at O
and O
should O
fit O
well O
next O
to O
each O
other O
. O

 O
And O
that O
experience O
is O
going O
to O
come O
in O
handy O
when O
they O
try O
to O
fit O
both O
Skadilicious B-PLAYER
and O
XemistrY B-PLAYER
into O
roles O
on O
a O
team O
that O
will O
be O
competing O
for O
every O
qualifier O
spot O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O
Neither O
player O
has O
an O
extensive O
amount O
of O
tournament O
history O
, O
but O
XemistrY B-PLAYER
has O
a O
strong O
record O
coming O
from O
Athletico B-ORG
Esports I-ORG
, O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
teams O
in O
Australia O
. O

 O
At O
time O
of O
writing O
, O
it O
’s O
unclear O
which O
player O
will O
be O
the O
team O
captain O
, O
but O
all O
signs O
point O
to O
pieliedie B-PLAYER
since O
he O
’s O
coming O
off O
a O
great O
season O
where O
he O
led O
the O
Forward B-ORG
Gaming I-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newbee I-ORG
roster O
to O
a O
top-12 O
finish O
at O
TI9 B-TOURN
. O
It O
’s O
also O
unknown O
if O
XemistrY B-PLAYER
is O
going O
to O
be O
playing O
on O
loan O
from O
Athletico O
or O
if O
T1 B-ORG
acquired O
him O
outright O
. O

 O
None O
of O
these O
moves O
have O
been O
officially O
announced O
by O
T1 B-ORG
yet O
, O
but O
because O
the O
qualifiers O
for O
the O
DreamLeague B-TOURN
Season I-TOURN
13 I-TOURN
Major I-TOURN
are O
just O
two O
weeks O
away O
, O
it O
makes O
sense O
that O
the O
organization O
wants O
to O
get O
its O
team O
together O
early O
so O
they O
can O
start O
practicing O
. O
The O
only O
undefeated O
team O
remaining O
at O
the O
Dota B-TOURN
Summit I-TOURN

finally O
fell O
. O
Invictus B-ORG

to O
become O
the O
first O

to O

. O

 O
After O
surviving O
a O
tough O
battle O
against O
HellRaisers B-ORG
, O
dealing O
with O

proved O
little O
issue O
for O

, O
but O
the O
sequel O
looked O
pretty O
good O
in O
the O
opening O
act O
. O
Both O
sides O
landed O
some O
solid O
hits O
on O
each O
other O
early O
and O
the O
game O
hit O
a O
stalemate O
with O
the O
lead O
trading O
hands O
three O
times O
in O
the O
opening O
20 O
minutes O
. O

 O
Up O
until O
about O
the O
30-minute O
mark O
it O
looked O
like O
Chaos B-ORG
was O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
their O
lead O
. O
But O
iG B-ORG
fired O
their O
bullet O
at O
the O
perfect O
time O
, O
combining O

devastating O
effect O

 O

imploded O
during O
the O
home O
stretch O
. O
And O
just O
as O
the O
commentators O
were O
debating O
if O

would O
be O
able O
to O
stall O
long O
enough O
for O

to O
buyback O
, O
the O
team O
called O

. O

 O
Game O
two O
started O
as O
another O
close O
match O
where O
Chaos B-ORG
held O
onto O
a O
sliver O
of O
a O
lead O
for O
the O

minutes O
. O
But O
putting O

enough O
to O

that O

off O

there O

nothing O

once O

, O
but O
they O
were O
eliminated O
before O

 O
It O
just O
looks O
like O

, O
as O
the O
stack O
put O
everything O
they O
had O
into O
the O

Their O

will O
keep O
going O

 O
Aside O
from O

the O

, O
Peter B-PLAYER

were O
on O
their O
back O

throughout O
the O
opening O
match O
. O
The O
biggest O
weakness O
for O
the O

was O
failing O
to O

a O
way O
to O

going O
14/0/8 O
against O

 O
Palantimos B-PLAYER
was O
able O
to O
keep O

while O

picked O
off O

made O
sure O
that O
any O

was O
removed O
early O
on O
in O
every O

. O
That O
led O
to O
a O
slowly O
building O
lead O
that O

was O
unable O
to O
stop O
and O
an O
eventual O
1 O

lead O
for O
the O
CIS O

. O

 O
In O
game O
two O
, O
NiP B-ORG
slowly O
fell O
apart O
after O
building O
a O
lead O
. O
By O
the O
25-minute O
mark O
there O
were O
Meepos B-AVATAR
approaching O

four O
dead O
