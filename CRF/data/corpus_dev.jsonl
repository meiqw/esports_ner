It’s also unknown if XemistrY is going to be playing on loan from Athletico or if T1 acquired him outright.\nNone of these moves have been officially announced by T1 yet, but because the qualifiers for the DreamLeague Season 13 Major are just two weeks away, it makes sense that the organization wants to get its team together early so they can start practicing.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 2, "ORG"], [55, 59, "GAME"], [134, 154, "PLAYER"], [227, 233, "GAME"], [260, 284, "PLAYER"], [301, 333, "PLAYER"], [338, 358, "PLAYER"], [409, 414, "PLAYER"], [479, 486, "ORG"], [530, 538, "ORG"], [543, 557, "ORG"], [636, 644, "ORG"], [661, 680, "PLAYER"], [722, 727, "PLAYER"], [840, 842, "ORG"], [886, 895, "PLAYER"], [900, 920, "PLAYER"], [1290, 1302, "PLAYER"], [1307, 1315, "PLAYER"], [1470, 1478, "PLAYER"], [1511, 1528, "ORG"], [1671, 1680, "PLAYER"], [1735, 1756, "ORG"], [1812, 1820, "PLAYER"], [1786, 1789, "TOURN"], [1873, 1875, "ORG"], [1953, 1955, "ORG"], [119, 125, "GAME"], [1996, 2023, "TOURN"]]}

Despite being from an emerging region, League fans believed GAM had the potential to advance past the group stage—especially since they were drawn into a relatively weak group with Splyce and J Team.

This year, GAM re-signed star player Đỗ “Levi” Duy Khánh and dominated the VCS. GAM brought the aggression against J Team today, but it wasn’t enough to save them from elimination.\nThroughout their match, GAM were starting fights and making moves. But J Team seemed to always have a response. Twice in a row, GAM attempted to gank Hsu “Rest” Shih-Chieh on Renekton the top lane. And twice they were outplayed with Rest picking up kills and GAM showing up empty-handed. Failed attempts like this left J Team free to take neutral objectives, which they used to build a slow lead.\nLevi led the charge for GAM and continued forcing plays. GAM picked up kills where they could, but J Team never let them get too far ahead. A botched Baron attempt was the final stand for GAM. GAM killed J Team in the top lane, which gave them an open shot at the Baron. But J Team quickly rotated in response. Rest led J Team into the pit to engage onto GAM’s clustered players.

The idea was to play around Tim “Nemesis” Lipovšek’s Kayle after he’d get the champion to level 16.\nUnfortunately for Fnatic, RNG knew exactly how to play around their own carries and abuse the shortcomings that this Kayle-oriented team composition brought. Top laner Xie “Langx” Zhen-Ying had some great engages on Gnar, while superstar AD carry Jian “Uzi” Zi-Hao powered each teamfight with some picture-perfect Xayah play.\nBy the end of the game, Fnatic’s bottom lane ended with only eight deaths. And, while Nemesis was able to hit a significant power spike, he was far too late—RNG’s teamfighting was far superior and the rest of Fnatic was too far behind to make the Kayle carry work.\nWith this loss, Fnatic is now sitting at 1-2 in Group C. Many were confused with the team’s decision to run another non-standard bottom duo, especially with Martin “Rekkles” Larsson being one of the best late game ADCs in Europe, and Zdravets “Hylissang” Iliev Galabov thriving on engage-heavy champs like Pyke, Rakan, and Alistar.\nMeanwhile, RNG has quieted down some of the critics by finishing the first half of the group stage with a 2-1 record.

{"id": 447, "text": "Jay \"Sinatraa\" Won, Shock\nWithout a doubt, the most important player to watch at the Grand Finals is Sinatraa. He’s the Shock’s emotional leader, the mainstay damage player on their roster, and the regular-season MVP. It’s hard to put into words just how important Sinatraa is to San Francisco’s chances of success at the Grand Finals—he needs to step up to the plate and perform at his best for the Shock to be champions. We saw how big of a hit the Philadelphia Fusion took last year when their superstar Jae-Hyeok ”Carpe” Lee wasn’t performing up to par. San Francisco just can’t afford to have Sinatraa do anything but pound on his Doomfist.\nHyo-Jong \"Haksal\" Kim, Titans\nOvershadowed early on in the triple-tank, triple-support meta—due to playing Brigitte for a majority of the season—Haksal proved his importance in Stage 4 when role lock was finally put in place. Ever since, he’s been a vital pillar for Vancouver. While you can’t consider this a breakout season for a player who’s been lethal since 2017, you can say that he’s had quite a booming uptick in value since being released from Brigitte duty. Come Grand Finals, he will be the Titans’ most important asset on his Doomfist, not only in securing eliminations, but also in trying to shut down Sinatraa. It’s going to be a decisive matchup between Rookie of the Year Haksal and MVP Sinatraa—and I can already tell you right now that it will live up to the hype.\nHyo-Bin \"Choihyobin\" Choi, Shock\nWhile there are many notable players on this San Francisco roster, Choihyobin comes in as my second-most important player to watch. Sigma has been picked an impressive 98% of the time this postseason, and for good reason—he is just that good of a hero. While we saw Matthew \"Super\" DeLisi on main tank for most of the season, Myeong-Hwan \"Smurf\" Yoo has played Orisa throughout the postseason for what we can only assume is a team-chemistry-related reason. Gravitic Flux and Accretion are two of Sigma’s most important and valuable abilities, and it is crucial that Choihyobin utilizes his tank partner’s Orisa Halts well.\nJu-Seok \"Twilight\" Lee, Titans\nA Moira player? While it’s true that Sigma and Doomfist are arguably the two most important heroes in the postseason meta, a great deal of game tempo is decided by Moira’s Coalescence and orb usage. Twilight’s counterpart, Min-Ki \"Viol2t\" Park, tops five out of seven Moira categories (and ranks second in the other two), and given how important Moira play is, Twilight will have to be at his best to keep up with his Shock rival. While you really can’t put much weight behind the mechanics of Moira play, you can appreciate how teams dictate their fighting tempo depending on how they prioritize healing and damage, while building her Coalescence ultimate as quickly as possible. Keep a close eye on how Vancouver pushes aggressively and kites defensively depending on Twilight’s resource management.\nThe 2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals takes place Sept. 29 at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia and will air live on ABC and be livestreamed on Twitch, overwatchleague.com, and the Overwatch League app. Get the latest Grand Finals news and information here, and sign up for league newsletter updates here.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 18, "PLAYER"], [20, 25, "ORG"], [101, 109, "PLAYER"], [451, 470, "ORG"], [507, 528, "PLAYER"], [598, 606, "PLAYER"], [646, 667, "PLAYER"], [669, 675, "ORG"], [791, 797, "PLAYER"], [1148, 1154, "ORG"], [1261, 1269, "PLAYER"], [1334, 1340, "PLAYER"], [1349, 1357, "PLAYER"], [1429, 1454, "PLAYER"], [1529, 1539, "PLAYER"], [1728, 1750, "PLAYER"], [1788, 1811, "PLAYER"], [2028, 2038, "PLAYER"], [2085, 2107, "PLAYER"], [2109, 2115, "ORG"], [2927, 2944, "TOURN"], [120, 125, "ORG"], [265, 274, "PLAYER"], [280, 293, "ORG"], [400, 406, "ORG"], [557, 571, "ORG"], [636, 644, "AVATAR"], [753, 762, "AVATAR"], [913, 922, "ORG"], [1099, 1108, "AVATAR"], [1184, 1192, "AVATAR"], [1456, 1462, "ORG"], [1594, 1600, "AVATAR"], [1823, 1829, "AVATAR"], [1958, 1963, "AVATAR"], [2067, 2072, "AVATAR"], [2163, 2172, "AVATAR"], [2153, 2159, "AVATAR"], [2118, 2124, "AVATAR"], [2280, 2285, "AVATAR"], [2339, 2359, "PLAYER"], [2384, 2389, "AVATAR"], [2462, 2468, "AVATAR"], [2315, 2323, "ORG"], [2477, 2486, "ORG"], [2534, 2540, "ORG"], [2610, 2616, "AVATAR"], [2821, 2831, "ORG"], [2886, 2894, "ORG"], [3101, 3117, "TOURN"]]}

San Francisco’s pure aggression forced the more passive Spark to make mistakes, which were punished by the Shock’s superior ult management and synergy.\nOn the opening map Busan, it was all about Jay “Sinatraa” Won’s Doomfist as he constantly punched holes in the Spark’s defensive barriers, leading to a 2-1 win. The Shock then snowballed King’s Row at a blistering pace, with Sinatraa and damage partner Nam-Ju “Striker” Gwon competing to see who could get the most multi-eliminations. The Spark put up an aggressive defense in the time-bank round, but it was too little, too late.\nBacks against the wall, the Spark made Temple of Anubis one of the most grueling maps of the playoffs for the Shock, as the battle ventured into not just one, but two time-bank rounds. Both teams pushed each other to the limit, but the Shock pulled out an unexpected Mei on their second time-bank defense to secure a hold before breaking through on attack to give themselves three match points.\nGoing into Dorado, the Shock subbed out both their damage players, bringing in Min-Ho “Architect” Park and Dong-Jun “Rascal” Kim. On his signature hero Mei, Rascal provided a match-winning Blizzard in the time-bank round, freezing the Spark’s push midway to Point B. The Spark tried to fight back with their own Blizzard, but the Shock had ults of their own, and easily withstood Hangzhou’s last-ditch efforts.\nTwo teams remain in the hunt for the remaining Grand Finals spot—the Shock and Excelsior.

While the NYXL continued to show their flexibility, the Titans were led by their unstoppable damage star, Haksal, whose Doomfist came in clutch at crucial moments.\nThe Titans took command early with a 2-0 win on Lijiang Tower, where their superior ult synergy gave New York no openings. On King’s Row, Hae-Seong “Libero” Kim came alive to hand-deliver the Titans their second loss on the map this season.\nNYXL rode their momentum, nearly completing a full hold on Temple of Anubis Point A before Vancouver pushed through, courtesy of a multi-elimination by Haksal. On their first attack round, Jong-Ryeol “Saebyeolbe” Park’s Bastion wrecked the Titans defense in a speedy snowball. The NYXL then reverted back to a more conventional Doomfist-Reaper comp for their time-bank attack to throw the Titans off and take the map.\nThe Titans responded fearlessly on Watchpoint: Gibraltar as they halted the NYXL before Point C after getting all three points with four minutes to spare. The second Control map, Busan, was a repeat of the first as Haksal turned it into his playground. The Titans took it with an equally dominant 2-0 score to secure match point.\nBut the NYXL threw the gauntlet down on Numbani by completing their attack not once, but twice—the second time after a series of close teamfights, nearly all of them in overtime. They then bagged a full hold during their time-bank defense to give the Titans their second loss on Numbani after holding a two-year win streak on the map.\nFinally, it all came down to Dorado. Support Ju-Seok “Twilight” Lee was huge for the Titans as Ana on their attack—hitting clutch Sleep Darts that allowed the rest of the team to dismantle the Excelsior’s Bastion-Pharah setup. Despite a strong start to New York’s attack, they couldn’t press their advantages at the start of the map, struggling to capture Point A and never recovering their tempo.\nIt’s not the end of the road for the NYXL, however, as they still have a chance to schedule a rematch at the Grand Finals if they can win on Sunday.

The Spark consistently dismantled their opponents’ damage dealers before teamfights, preventing the Reign from ever building up any momentum.\nFrom the very start on Busan, the Spark focused down Andrej “Babybay” Francisty’s Reaper, causing the Reign to overextend—resulting in a cozy 2-0 win. Numbani was a battle of Bastion comps; after the Spark completed their offense in overtime, the Reign pushed back immediately by taking Point B with nearly five minutes left on the clock. But the Spark put up a phenomenal defense with GodsB’s vicious Bastion, forcing the Reign to get their three points in overtime as well. The Spark then pulled off a miraculous time-bank round by riding the payload to the end in overtime, once again before stopping Atlanta just after Point A.\nThe Spark continued to steamroll their advantage on Temple of Anubis with Jun-Ki “Bazzi” Park’s Doomfist still punching Babybay out of the ring early on. The Reign put up a heroic defense in the time-bank round, but in another Bastion head-to-head, it was GodsB who came out on top once again.\nA final glimmer of hope appeared for the Reign in the form of Jun “Erster” Jeong’s Genji in their attack round on Watchpoint: Gibraltar. He was able to counter Hangzhou’s Bastion comp, but it was too little, too late. The Spark showed their adaptability by shutting down Erster, then rode the payload to a dominant victory in yet another time-bank round.\nSHOCK BID GLADIATORS GOODBYE\nMatch at a Glance\nResult: San Francisco Shock win 4-0\nPlayer of the Match: Hyo-Bin “Choihyobin“ Choi\nStat: Choihyobin as Sigma got 123 eliminations and 31 Accretion kills\nFull match VOD\nThe San Francisco Shock delivered a second quick elimination on Thursday night as they took out the Los Angeles Gladiators 4-0. The Shock showed off their flexibility as they rolled out all four of their damage players, adapting to their opponent’s tactics while pulling off their own well-practiced strategies.\nLeague MVP Jay “Sinatraa” Won was prime among them as his Doomfist helped the Shock punch their way to a scrappy win on Busan Downtown. He followed that up on MEKA Base by bringing out a shield-destroying Sombra to obliterate an attempted Bastion comp from the Gladiators.\nThe Gladiators were still reeling on the next map, King’s Row, and allowed the Shock to roll through Point B with little resistance, before shaving off around four minutes and forcing an overtime completion. On LA’s own attack round, Gui-Un “Decay” Jang made space as Doomfist to help the Gladiators perform their own speedrun through the first two points, but the Shock were surprisingly aggressive on the penultimate corner and stopped the Gladiators from pushing the payload to the end.\nThe Gladiators’ determination didn’t disappear as they went into Horizon Lunar Colony, which they took to a time-bank round. In the end, Sinatraa’s Sombra counterpick unraveled LA’s Bastion-Mei defense once again, getting off some clutch hacks to shut down important abilities and building EMP at crucial moments.\nRefusing to go down without a fight, the Gladiators took Rialto to a time-bank round as well. João Pedro “Hydration” Goes Telles swapped back from his Sigma duties to play Pharah, adding aerial pressure with his direct rocket hits. The Shock clearly weren’t too fazed, though, as they stuck to the payload like glue and set the fourth fastest attack completion time.\nWith the sweep, San Francisco advances to face Hangzhou on Saturday.\nThe 2019 Overwatch League Playoffs continue on Friday.
